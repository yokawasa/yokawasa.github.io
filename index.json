ZOZOTOWN is the largest fashion online shopping website in Japan run by ZOZO (https://corp.zozo.com/en/). It was launched in 2004, implimented as monoliths, and became a big fat monolith application built upon onprem as it grew. In last 3 years they have worked on ZOZOTOWN modernization project that they call ‘ZOZOTOWN replace’ where they achived gradual migration to kubernetes-based microservice architecture and adopted istio / service mesh as a key enabler for our new ZOZOTOWN platform. Topics covered in the presentation will include:\n ZOZO’s gradual migration storategy How they integrated Isito into their microservice platform where they had their existing in-house API Gateway How they achieved zero downtime migration to istio-based microservice architecture Further Istio usage at ZOZO to achive more sophisticated DevOps experience  You can find the session info on the event site as well: https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/sessions/accelerating-zozotown-modernization/\nUpdated on May 16, 2022 - Video is here:   Why I applied for the CFP? I applied for the Call For Proposals (CPF) for the IstioCon 2022 with the following motivations:\n To share knowlege and usecase of Istio / service mesh with the community To raise your technical presence of the company in the area of Istio service mesh To step out of my comfort zone by presenting in English (my 2nd language)  The biggest motivation is #3 - giving presentation in English. As a Japanese, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty comfortable with the presentation in Japanese (see my presentations history at public event) but NOT with the one in English. There was the time when I was a part of global team and had many chances to give English presentation. But in my current role I haven\u0026rsquo;t have a chance for about 2.5 years, thus I got to be reluctant to do in English and even worse I became conscious of my weakness in presenting myself in English. So, applying for the CFP (ie. to give the presentaion in English) was to overcome my weakness.\nI\u0026#39;m super excited to present at #IstioCon 2022! It\u0026#39;s a 10 min lightning talk. Talk title is \u0026quot;Accelerating ZOZOTOWN Modernization with Istio\u0026quot; 🚀\n10分枠のLTで発表します。日本時間 4/29 12:50amだよ。頑張るぜ！💪https://t.co/TGfpEbBcGw pic.twitter.com/gAqyZOxw6i\n\u0026mdash; Yoichi Kawasaki (@yokawasa) March 31, 2022  What I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt through event The challenge turned out very well. After the challenge, I got to be feeling very positive about joining the global event like IstioCon. Also I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt alot from the event.\n There is no barriers to joining the global event except language and timezone. Speaking of the language, there is more chance to pre-record the presentation which allow non native English speakers elaborate and spend as much time on the presentation to get over language difficulties. All you need is motivation and guts There are alot more things to do with Istio / service mesh to improve the application modernization that I\u0026rsquo;m working on. Speed of innovation in this are is very fast and there are many advanced Istio service mesh usecase in the world to catch up with. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to view a talk you missed, you can replay content if you\u0026rsquo;re registered at https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/, and also sessions records will be available on YouTube in the next few weeks (ref).  These are the biggest harvests I\u0026rsquo;ve gained from attending this event.\nI really thank you to the organizers of IstioCon and the community for the awesome event!\nBTW - Big news on Istio and CNCF There was a big news during IstioCon day1 keynote - the Istio project has applied to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

You are allowed to look up the following sites during the exam  kubernetes.io/docs kubernetes.io/blog/ github.com/kubernetes   For both CKA and CKAD: the following are books that I found useful for CKA and CKAD. They are defenitly helpful to understand how to manage and operate the kubernetes cluster. Pick one or two that you think good fit and read through:  Book: Kubernetes: Up and Running Book: Managing Kubernetes (Free PDF by Heptio is here) Book(日本語): Kubernetes完全ガイド Book(日本語): しくみがわかるKubernetes Azureで動かしながら学ぶコンセプトと実践知識 Book(日本語): Kubernetes実践入門 プロダクションレディなコンテナ＆アプリケーションの作り方   For CKA: learn how to install, configure \u0026amp; validate kubernetes cluster. These are good materials to go through:  Kubernetes the hard way (GCP) Kubernetes the hard way on Azure (Azure)   For CKA: learn how to troubleshoot the cluster. I recommend to read the following pages in kubernetes.io  Determine the Reason for Pod Failure Application Introspection and Debugging Debug Services   For CKA: these below are Github repo that I though very useful for CKA exam preps:  Kubernetes-Certified-Administrator   For CKAD: these below are Github repo that I thought very very useful for CKAD exam preps:  CKAD Exercises   For both: it\u0026rsquo;s very important to know a quick way to achieve goals by using kubectl. You can lookup kubernetes.io during the exam but it\u0026rsquo;s always good to know shortcut ways as the exam time is limited (CKA = 3hrs / CKAD = 2hrs)  Kubectl Cheat Sheet Creating template YAML using kubectl dry-run and edit it instead of creating YAML from scratch # Pod template $ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never --dry-run -o yaml # Deployment template $ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml # Servcie template $ kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port 8080 --dry-run -o yaml # [NOTE1] # You can change resource to release by changing --restart option: # kind | option # --------------------------------------------- # deployment | none # pod | --restart=Never # job | --restart=OnFailure # cronjob | --schedule=\u0026#39;cron format(0/5 * * * ? など)\u0026#39; # [NOTE2] # In case that kubectl run will be deprecated in the future, $ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml    Tips during the exam  ID: Candidates are required to provide government-issued photo identification before the Exam (Read Candidate Handbook). For non-english language folks, Passport would be the best! Testing Room: you need to prepare a room for testing which must be quiet, private and well lit. Virtual screen: you can virtual screen like tmux and screen. It would be very helpful to use multple screens like using one for deploying kuberenetes resources while using the other one for looking up kuberentes resource state and logs. For example, I\u0026rsquo;m a tmux user, and added the following .tmux.conf before starting tackling with questions: set-option -g prefix C-z  Command alias: Setting up alias definitly help you to shorten the time you need to type in commands. For examples, alias k=kubectl  Time management: Don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time on difficult questions. Try to finish all easy questions first and spend the rest for difficult ones. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to beat everything to pass the exam!! - A score of at least 74% for CKA and 66% for CKAD to pass the exam Searchability: you can use and search the kubernetes.io pages. Even if you have no idea on questions on the exam, don\u0026rsquo;t give up and try to type some keywords to search the kubernetes.io pages. You may be lucky enough to find some hints or right answers on the site.    Final comments Again, the most important tip for both exams is to read and understand the exam curriculum and all relevant pages on kubernetes.io. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to memorize but understand them. Event if you don\u0026rsquo;t come up with exact command options or kubernetes resource objects for questions in the exam, you can lookup and point to appropriate pages during the exam. In addition, get familiar with basic linux commands and cluster operations and management commands. If you have any questions, send DM to me @yokawasa.\nGood luck with your exams!\nps.

But when I first saw this procedure, I thought this was very troublesome. Lazy person like me couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept going thourgh all the steps just to SSH into AKS cluster nodes VMs. This is why I decided to create kubectl-plugin-ssh-jump, a kubectl plugin to SSH into Kubernetes nodes using a SSH jump host Pod.\nAKS node access control and SSH access strategy By default, AKS nodes are not exposed to the internet, and they are completely isolated to their own virtual network. This is why I took a strategy to go through a jump host Pod to connect to the Kubernetes nodes. I believe this is pretty a general strategy in dealing with firewalling, access privileges, etc.\nRegarding SSH key with which you access the nodes via SSH, you need to use the SSH key that you chosen in creating your AKS cluster. Or in the case that you lose the key, you can update SSH Key by using az command like this (See this for more detail):\naz vm user update \\ --resource-group myResourceGroup \\ --name myVM \\ --username azureuser \\ --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub As an additional security enhancement, you can configure Access Control(IAM) on the AKS cluster to set permissions on the nodes on who can access them.

The filter ( http_filters in the demo ) can be used to inject delays and abort requests with user-specified error codes.\nFront-proxy configurations are the same as the ones in HTTP Routing: Simple Match Routing. Differences from HTTP Routing: Simple Match Routing are the following 2 fault injections:\n Fault injection abort (50% of requests will be aborted with 503 error code) for the requests to service_red Fault injection delay (50% of requests will be 10 seconds delayed) for the requests to service_blue  Key definition 1 - http_filters in service-envoy-fault-injection-abort.yaml\n http_filters:  - name: envoy.fault  config:  abort:  http_status: 503  percentage:  numerator: 50  denominator: HUNDRED  For numerator and denominator of percentage, see type.FractionalPercent\n Key definition 2 - http_filters in service-envoy-fault-injection-delay.yaml\n http_filters:  - name: envoy.fault  config:  delay:  type: fixed  fixed_delay: 10s  percentage:  numerator: 50  denominator: HUNDRED  For fixed_delay and percentage of delay injection, see config.filter.fault.v2.FaultDelay\n To continue, go to github\nCircuit Breaker Circuit Breaking lets you configure failure thresholds that ensure safe maximums after which these requests stop. This allows for a more graceful failure, and time to respond to potential issues before they become larger.\n Circuit Breaker is configured in service_red such that Circuit Breaker will be triggered with the following conditions:  Envoy makes more than max connection#:1 Envoy makes more than max parallel requests#:1    Key definition - clusters in service-envoy-circuitbreaker.yaml\n clusters:  - name: local_service  connect_timeout: 0.25s  type: strict_dns  lb_policy: round_robin  circuit_breakers:  thresholds:  max_connections: 1  max_pending_requests: 1  max_requests: 1  hosts:  - socket_address:  address: 127.0.0.1  port_value: 8080  For the detail of circuit_breakers configuration, see cluster.CircuitBreakers\n To continue, go to github\nTimeouts and Retries Front-proxy configurations are the same as the ones in HTTP Routing: Simple Match Routing. Differences from HTTP Routing: Simple Match Routing are the following 2 additional behaviors:\n Timeouts (5 seconds) for the request to service_blue Retries that Envoy will attempt to do if service_red responds with any 5xx response code  For Service Containers, delay fault injection and abort fault injection are configured in service_blue and service_red respectively (which are the same configuration as the ones in Fault Injection Demo)\nKey definition - virtual_hosts in front-envoy.yaml\n virtual_hosts:  - name: backend  domains:  - \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;  routes:  - match:  prefix: \u0026#34;/service/blue\u0026#34;  route:  cluster: service_blue  timeout: 5s  - match:  prefix: \u0026#34;/service/green\u0026#34;  route:  cluster: service_green  - match:  prefix: \u0026#34;/service/red\u0026#34;  route:  cluster: service_red  retry_policy:  retry_on: \u0026#34;5xx\u0026#34;  num_retries: 3  per_try_timeout: 5s   timeout: (Duration) Specifies the timeout for the route.

As of release Kubernetes v1.7, Dashboard no longer has full admin privileges granted by default. All the privileges are revoked and only minimal privileges granted, that are required to make Dashboard work. With default priviledge, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the following errors showed up on the Dashboard.\n[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)] RBAC is enabled by default Since Azure CLI version 2.0.40, RBAC is enabled by default. As you can see in the Azure command help, your cluster is RBAC enabled unless you specify --disable-rbac during the creation of the cluster.\n$ az --version azure-cli (2.0.43) $ az aks create --help --disable-rbac : Disable Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control. --enable-rbac -r [Deprecated] : Enable Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control.

Option 1: Access to Dashboard with your Service Account In option 1, I introduce how to give priviledge your Service Account and access to the Dashboard with the account. Actually there are a couple of authorization options, and here I introduce how to authorize with Bear Token\n[NOTE] According to this,\n As of release 1.7 Dashboard supports user authentication based on:\n Authorization: Bearer header passed in every request to Dashboard. Supported from release 1.6. Has the highest priority. If present, login view will not be shown. Bearer Token that can be used on Dashboard login view. Username/password that can be used on Dashboard login view (Disabled by default) Kubeconfig file that can be used on Dashboard login view   1-1. Create your Service Account for Dashboard access First of all, create your Service Account my-admin-user like this:\n$ kubectl create serviceaccount my-admin-user -n kube-system Or you can create the Service Account with the following YAML my-sa.yaml and deploying it with kubectl create -f my-sa.yaml:\n# my-sa.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: my-admin-user namespace: kube-system Check if your Service Account (my-admin-user) has been added.\n$ kubectl get sa -n kube-system NAME SECRETS AGE addon-http-application-routing-external-dns 1 9d addon-http-application-routing-nginx-ingress-serviceaccount 1 9d attachdetach-controller 1 9d certificate-controller 1 9d clusterrole-aggregation-controller 1 9d cronjob-controller 1 9d daemon-set-controller 1 9d default 1 9d deployment-controller 1 9d disruption-controller 1 9d endpoint-controller 1 9d generic-garbage-collector 1 9d heapster 1 9d horizontal-pod-autoscaler 1 9d job-controller 1 9d kube-dns 1 9d kube-proxy 1 9d kube-svc-redirector 1 9d kubernetes-dashboard 1 9d my-admin-user 1 15s namespace-controller 1 9d node-controller 1 9d persistent-volume-binder 1 9d pod-garbage-collector 1 9d pv-protection-controller 1 9d pvc-protection-controller 1 9d replicaset-controller 1 9d replication-controller 1 9d resourcequota-controller 1 9d route-controller 1 9d service-account-controller 1 9d service-controller 1 9d statefulset-controller 1 9d ttl-controller 1 9d tunnelfront 1 9d 1-2. Binding the role cluster-admin to the Service Account Create a ClusterRoleBinding which gives the role cluster-admin (= full admin priviledge) to the ServiceAccount my-admin-user\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-admin-user -n kube-system --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:my-admin-user Or you can grant the priviledges with the following YAML my-sa-binding.yaml and deploying it with kubectl create -f my-sa-binding.yaml:\n# my-sa-binding.yaml apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: my-admin-user roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: my-admin-user namespace: kube-system 1-3.

Give Bear Token at Dashboard login view Now that you have a bear token that you need to grant the full priviledges to your Service Account, let\u0026rsquo;s access to the Dashboard login view.\nFirst of all, create a proxy to the dashboard:\n$ kubectl proxy Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001 Then, access to the Dashboard login page:\n$ open http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy/#!/login Or if it\u0026rsquo;s on Azure, you can leverage Azure CLI command to access the Dashboard like this:\n$ az aks browse --resource-group \u0026lt;RESOURCE_GROUP\u0026gt; --name \u0026lt;CLUSTER_NAME\u0026gt; $ open http://127.0.0.1:8001/#!/login You will see the following Dashboard login view. Choose Token option and enter the bear token you got above. You will be able to access and operate with the Dashboard without any errors. Easy login by giving Authorization header using Browser extention As introduced in here, install Requestly browser plugin and configure to make Dashboard use authorization header. You simply need to configure the plugin to pass the following header in accessing the dashboard:\nAuthorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; HERE is the example screen shot:\nOption2: Granting admin privileges to Dashboard\u0026rsquo;s Service Account In Option 2, I introduce how to give full privilege (role: cluster-admin) to the Dashboard\u0026rsquo;s Service Account kubernetes-dashboard. With this option, you can skip the authorization process that you do in the option 1 to access Dashboard. However, as mentioned here, granting admin privileges to Dashboard\u0026rsquo;s Service Account might be a security risk.\nFirst of all, create a ClusterRoleBinding which gives the role cluster-admin (= full admin priviledge) to the ServiceAccount kubernetes-dashboard\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard Or you can do the same with the following YAML dashboard-sa-binding.yaml and deploying it with kubectl create -f dashboard-sa-binding.yaml:\n# dashboard-sa-binding.yaml apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: kubernetes-dashboard labels: k8s-app: kubernetes-dashboard roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: kubernetes-dashboard namespace: kube-system Finally, access to the Dashboard.

Markdown don\u0026rsquo;t support all HTML components such as embeded, iframe, align, etc. What I did for this modification parts are basically:\n All embeded parts such as Youtube video, slideshare, and gist links (Markdown doesn\u0026rsquo;t support embeded tags) Table tags part (I used Wordpress Table plugin that express table with very special tag, which of course can not be automatically convered to Markdown )  Markdown CheatSheet was very helpful in this part\nPublish the site uisng Jekyll and Github Pages Install the same github-pages gem and ruby as the ones used in Github page Go to this page to get ruby and github-pages version used in Github page.

You can configure the way to route network traffic to the endpoints by choosing traffic routing methods available in Traffic Manager.\nConfiguration procedure Suppose that you have 2 AMS accounts (amsaccount1, amsaccount2), and that you want to distribute requests to your Traffic Manager domain (myamsstreaming.trafficmanager.net) from video player clients to streaming endpoints in AMS. When AMS endpoints are added to an Azure Traffic Manager profile (myamsstreaming), Azure Traffic Manager keeps track of the status of your AMS streaming endpoints (running, stopped, or deleted) so that it can decide which of those endpoints should receive traffic. However, when it comes to AMS endpoints, it has to be toward a custom domain, NOT simply a Traffic Manager domain for clients\u0026rsquo; traffic to be distributed into AMS endpoints using Traffic Manager. So let\u0026rsquo;s suppose you prepare a custom domain: streaming.mydomain.com.\nExample accounts and domains\n AMS Account1: amsaccount1 (Streaming endpoint: amsaccount1.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net) AMS Account2: amsaccount2 (Streaming endpoint: amsaccount2.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net) Traffic Manager Domain: myamsstreaming.trafficmanager.net Custom Domain: streaming.mydomain.com  (1) Point a custom domain to a Traffic Manager domain You add the following alias (CNAME) to point the custom domain to the traffic manager domain:\nstreaming.mydomain.com IN CNAME myamsstreaming.trafficmanager.net Useful Link for this step: Point a company Internet domain to an Azure Traffic Manager domain\n(2) Add Azure Media Services origin hosts to the Traffic Manager Add AMS endpoints to an Azure Traffic Manager profile as \u0026ldquo;External Endpoint\u0026rdquo; via either Azure Portal or Azure CLI / PowerShell. Here is an image of adding endpoints in Azure portal:\nUseful Link for this step: Add, disable, enable, or delete endpoints\n(3) Custom domain name ownership verification First of all, get Media Service Account IDs (GUID) for your AMS accounts in this step. To find the Azure Media Service ID , go to the Azure portal and select your Media Service account. The Azure Media Service ID appears on the right of the DASHBOARD page. Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose you get the following account IDs for AMS accounts (amsaccount1, amsaccount2):\n Account ID: 8dcbe520-59c7-4591-8d98-1e765b7f3729 for AMS account: amsaccount1 Account ID: 5e0e6784-4ed0-40a0-8444-33da6d4f7171 for AMS account: amsaccount2  Then, create CNAME that maps (accountId).(parent custom domain) to verifydns.(mediaservices-dns-zone). This is necessary to proves that the Azure Media Services ID has the ownership of the custom domain. Here are CNAMEs to create in this step:\n## \u0026lt;MediaServicesAccountID\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;custom parent domain\u0026gt; IN CNAME verifydns.\u0026lt;mediaservices-dns-zone\u0026gt; ## Custom name Ownership verification for amsaccount1 8dcbe520-59c7-4591-8d98-1e765b7f3729.mydomain.com IN CNAME verifydns.mediaservices.windows.net ## Custom name Ownership verification for amsaccount2 5e0e6784-4ed0-40a0-8444-33da6d4f7171.mydomain.com IN CNAME verifydns.mediaservices.windows.net Refer to CustomHostNames section of StreamingEndpoint document to learn more about the configuration in this step.\n(4) Add Custom host name to each Azure Media Service streaming endpoint Once you completed \u0026ldquo;Custom domain name ownership verification\u0026rdquo; configuration, you then need to configure to add custom host name to each Azure Media Service streaming endpoint. Unfortunately new portal doesn\u0026rsquo;t include capability to add custom domain to the streaming endpoint. You can set it either using REST API directly or using Azure Media Explorer. Here is how you add custom host name to the streaming endpoint in Azure Media Explorer:\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Streaming endpoint\u0026rdquo; in the top menu, right click on your streaming endpoint, and select \u0026ldquo;Streaming endpoint information and settings\u0026rdquo;. In Streaming endpoint information form, type in your custom host name for the endpoint, and click \u0026ldquo;Update settings and close\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\n(5) Test video playback with your custom domain Once all configurations above are completed (+ DNS settings are reflected), you will see the custom domain name lookup points to either of AMS endpoints added to the traffic manager like this:\n$ dig streaming.mydomain.com ;; ANSWER SECTION: streaming.mydomain.com. 600 IN CNAME myamsstreaming.trafficmanager.net. myamsstreaming.trafficmanager.net. 300 IN CNAME amsaccount1.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net. amsaccount1.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net. 60 IN CNAME wamsorigin-origin-903f1f37105244fba2270ae7b64021bd.cloudapp.net. wamsorigin-origin-903f1f37105244fba2270ae7b64021bd.cloudapp.net. 60 IN A 104.215.4.76 Make sure to check if the custom name lookup points to the other endpoint when one of the endpoints are down.\nFinally, check if you can playback video with your custom domain.\n$ curl

on Azure 設計・構築ノウハウ」というお題でお話をさせていただいた。個人的にとても大好きなプロダクトなので、そのユーザーカンファレンスでお話をさせていただいたということと、そのプロダクトのAzureでの利用促進に微力ながらも貢献できたということは光栄至極である。ここではそのElastic {ON} Tourでの発表で使用したスライドに補足解説を加えて共有させていただく。\nセッションスライド（＋デモ動画） \n15分でお届けする Elastic Stack on Azure 設計・構築ノウハウ from Yoichi Kawasaki\n補足解説 デプロイメント AzureでのElastic Stackの利用は当然ながら仮想マシン（VM）を並べてそこにクラスタを構築することになる。残念ながら現時点でマネージドのElasticサービスはAzureには存在しない。VMベースということで特にオンプレと変わらずマニュアルであったり、ChefやAnsibleなどの構成管理ツールを使ってクラスタを組んだり柔軟な構築が可能であるものの、ここではAzureでの構築ということでARMテンプレートを使ったデプロイメントの方法を紹介している。\n Azure Marketplaceからのデプロイ：最も手っ取り早い方法。30日のX-Packトライアルライセンスが付いていて、トライアル期間が過ぎてもBYOLでライセンスの更新が可能。テンプレートでは2017年12月時点でv2.0.2 〜 v5.6.3の選択が可能。何も考えず最新版をご利用ください。 Github上のARMテンプレートをカスタマイズしてデプロイ：Elastic社が用意したGithub上のARMテンプレートがあるのでそれを自分の要件に応じてカスタマイズしてデプロイメントをする。Azure CLIやPowerShellなどコマンドを使ったデプロイメントが可能なので構成管理ツールに組み込んで周辺環境を合わせて自動構築設定も可能。慣れてきたらこちらがよいでしょう。  推奨仮想ハードウェアとDISK Elasticクラスタ全体のパフォーマンスを引き出すためには機能別に適正なVMインスタンスとサイズを選択ください。またVMにアタッチするディスクについてはビルトインで可用性設定がされているManaged Disk、もしくはPremium Managed Diskを選択することをお忘れなく。\n可用性の設定について AzureでIaaSで可用性の設定といえばおなじみの可用性セット（Availability Set）と可用性ゾーン（Availability Zone）。当然Elastic Stackのクラスタを組む時もこれらの設定を入れましょうというお話。可用性ゾーンは、その可用性レベルの高さから将来的には可用性ゾーンが主流な設定になっていくはずであるものの、2017年12月時点でPreviewリリースであり、利用可能リージョンが米国東部第２、西ヨーロッパのみというとても限定的なものとなっている。現時点でプロダクション用途となると可用性セット一択なので何も考えずに可用性セットを組んでください。\n可用性セット（Availability Set）\n 一つのDCの中で同一の物理ラックや電源などを配置しないようにして、障害が発生してもグループの中のどこかのVMは生きているようにする設定のこと VM SLA 99.95%で提供  可用性ゾーン（Availability Zone）\n 各VMを別々のゾーンに配置するのでDCレベルの障害につよい（それぞれゾーンは電源、ネットワーク、冷却装置が完全に物理的に分離されたものとなっている）。ちなみに、Azureのリージョンは複数のデータセンターで構成されており、その間を高速なバックボーンで接続して1つのリージョンとして透過的に利用が可能となっているのでこのようなことができるわけだ VM SLA 99.99%で提供 【注意点】可用性ゾーンの設定ではDCが分かれて配置されるので次の２点の考慮が必要：（１）マスターは各ゾーンに分散するように各ゾーン最低１ノード配置すること（２）データノードはゾーンにまたがる通信が極力起こらないように工夫すること。これを実現するのがShard Allocation Awarenessという仕組みで、この仕組みをつかうことで 同一ゾーン内に配置されているノードだけで完全なシャードを保持するようにして、検索要求が同一ゾーン内で完結できるように設定が可能となる  ネットワークセキュリティグループの設定 AzureのIaaSにおけるネットワークフィルタリングの設定に、ネットワークセキュリティグループ（NSG）とよばれるL4フィルタリングがある。当然ながら、既にX-Packを導入していればそのセキュリティ機能の１つとしてネットワークレベルのアクセス制御についても行うことができるが、X-Packを導入していない場合は確実にNSGの設定は必要になってくる。また、Elastic Stack以外のアプリケーションとの連携の際にも必ず必要になってくる。Azure上でのシステム構築では欠かすことのできない設定の１つ。\nAzureサービスからのデータコレクション Azure VMについては、オンプレ同様に、ビルトインのBeatsやlogstashとの連携により、そのログやMetricsなどのデータコレクションを実現することができる。一方、Azureが特に力を入れているPaaS（Platform as a Services）からのデータコレクションについてはどうかというと、下記のサービスについては既にビルトインで用意されている機能や、コミュニティ製Logstash Input プラグインを利用することでデータコレクションを実現することができる。 H2M_LI_HEADER Azure Blob Storage: logstash-input-azureblob H2M_LI_HEADER Azure Service Bus (Topic): logstash-input-azuretopic H2M_LI_HEADER Azure Event Hub: logstash-input-azureeventhub H2M_LI_HEADER Azure SQL Database: logstash-input-jdbc H2M_LI_HEADER Azure Database for MySQL: logstash-input-jdbc H2M_LI_HEADER Azure Database for PostgreSQL: logstash-input-jdbc H2M_LI_HEADER Azure HDInsight: ES-Hadoopによる連携\nちなみに、Azureサービス向けLogstashプラグイン一覧についてはこちら - Logstash plugins for Microsoft Azure Services\nAzure Diagnostics、Activities、Metricsログのコレクション 基本的にIaaS、PaaS問わずAzureのほとんどのサービスから下記の情報が出力され、これらの情報はBlobストレージまたはEvent Hubに出力設定が可能となっている。 H2M_LI_HEADER 診断ログ（Diagnostics log） H2M_LI_HEADER アクティビティログ（Activity log） H2M_LI_HEADER メトリック\nまた上記に加えて、PaaSサービスに展開するアプリケーション固有のログについても少なくともBlobストレージに書き込むことはできる。つまるところ、上記データコレクションの項目でご紹介したようにBlobストレージやEvent hubに出力されたデータはLogstashを通じてElastic Stackに取り込むことが可能であり、Azureリソース関連情報を含めた全てのログはElastic Stackで一元管理することができるのである。\n参考Links  Deploying Elasticsearch on Microsoft Azure Microsoft AzureにElasticsearchをデプロイする Elasticsearch and Kibana Deployments

Pythonがある。あまり情報が無い中、興味本位でサンプルコードを作っては動かして試して得られた情報をシコシコとGithubに上げているうちにナレッジが溜まって来た。それほど多くはないと思うがPythonでAzure Functionsアプリを作りたいという人もいると思うのでノウハウをブログにまとめておく。いきなり水を差すようではあるが、現時点（2017年12月）ではAzure FunctionsのPythonサポータビリティはExperimental（実験的サポート）でありプロダクション向きではない状況であるので、ホントにPythonが好きな人がOn your own riskで楽しんでいただければと思う。\nAzure FunctionsのPythonサポート状況 Azure FunctionsのRuntimeには大きく1系と２系の２種類あるが、現時点でPythonは1系でのみExperimentalサポートという状況（ See also 言語サポート状況）\nExperimental（実験的サポート）なので本番での利用は非推奨であり、公式サポートはない（ベストエフォートでのサポートは得られるはず）。また、当然ながらGA言語に比べパフォーマンスは悪い。PythonはFunction呼び出し毎にpython.exeが実行される（GA言語はRuntimeと同じプロセスで実行）。\n将来的な話をすると、Azure Functions Runtime 1系でのPythonサポートについては今のExperimentalの域を超えることはないだろう。一方、Runtime 2系ではPythonが正式サポートされるように対応が進められている。ただし時期は未定。この対応については下記Github Issueが切られており、ある程度の対応状況であれば確認可能。Pythonを使う利点の１つに、強力な数理計算、自然言語解析、機械学習系モジュールがあるが、早く安定とパフォーマンスが備わったPythonサーバレスアプリ実行環境でこれら強力なモジュールを活用できたらと思うのは私だけではないだろう。今後の進展に期待。\n Feature planning: first class Python support  Hosting Planの選択について Consumption Plan vs App Service Plan Azure FunctionsのHosting PlanにはConsumption PlanとApp Service Planの2つがあって、言語に関係なく各プランの特徴は次の通り:\nConsumption Plan\n コード実行時にコンピューティング割り当て リソース使用量（関数実行時間、使用メモリ）で課金 自動スケール、各処理は〜10分まで  App Service Plan\n 専用VMでリソース確保 継続処理：10分以上の処理 App Service環境でのみ可能な処理: App Service Environment, VNET/VPN接続, より大きなサイズのVM, etc  Pythonで使う上で気をつけるポイント  Python 3.XなどRuntimeの変更を行う場合は、専用環境である必要があってApp Service Plan必須 Consumption Planの場合、Pythonに限らずColdスタート問題という休眠したFunctionの起動が極端に遅くなる問題があるのだが、Pythonの場合は、GA言語に比べてパフォーマンスが悪く、SciPyなど重めのモジュールを利用すると絶望的に遅くなることからConsumption Planでの問題が特に顕著にでてくる。これまでの経験から、小さいインスタンスを並べるConsumption Planよりも比較的大きなサイズのVMが選べるApp Service Planの方が向いていることが多い。Pythonの場合は、予測可能なワークロードに対してApp Service Planで使うほうが問題が少ない。Consumption Planの魅力であるMicro Billing（使った分だけ課金）やリクエストに応じたオートスケーリングといった真のサーバレスに期待される要件は既に正式サポートしているC#、Nodeでやっていただくのがよいかと。  [参考] Coldスタート問題  Consumption Planにおける問題 Azure Functions Cold Start Workaround The only downside is that the consumption model that keeps the cost so dirt-cheap means that unless you are using your Function constantly (in which case, you might be better off with the non-consumption options anyway), you will often be hit with a long delay as your Function wakes up from hibernation 休眠したFunctionをどう起こすかがポイント。事前に空リクエストを送ることが考えられるが問題はタイミング（フォーム開いた時とか）  Python 3.Xランタイムへの変更方法 2017年12月時点のAzure

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Azure Media Encoder Standardでフレームごとの静止画生成 残念ながらFace APIはビデオコンテンツから直接顔検出することができないため、一旦ビデオコンテンツから各フレームごとの静止画を生成してその静止画を対象に処理を行う必要がある。ここでは各フレームごとの静止画生成にAzure Media Encoder Standard（MES）を利用する。MESを使うことでエンコードタスクとしてビデオコンテンツに対して様々な処理を行うことができるのだが、MESにはそのエンコードタスクの１つとしてサムネイル生成のためのタスクが用意されており、今回はこのサムネール生成タスクを利用する。他のエンコードタスク同様にサムネイル生成タスクについてもプリセットと呼ばれるエンコードに必要な情報を記述した XML または JSON形式ファイルを用意する必要がある。今回は1秒フレームごとにJPEG形式の静止画（サムネイル）を生成するために次のようなプリセット（amsmp-thumbnail-config.json）を用意した。\n{  \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: 1.0,  \u0026#34;Codecs\u0026#34;: [  {  \u0026#34;Start\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;00:00:00\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;Step\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;00:00:01\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;JpgImage\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;JpgLayers\u0026#34;: [  {  \u0026#34;Quality\u0026#34;: 90,  \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;JpgLayer\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;Width\u0026#34;: 640,  \u0026#34;Height\u0026#34;: 360  }  ]  }  ],  \u0026#34;Outputs\u0026#34;: [  {  \u0026#34;FileName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{Basename}_{Index}{Extension}\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;Format\u0026#34;: {  \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;JpgFormat\u0026#34;  }  }  ] } MESによるサムネイル処理実行方法やプリセットの詳細については「Media Encoder Standard を使用した高度なエンコード」や同ページの「サムネイルを生成する」項を参照ください。尚、今回のサムネイル生成のためのエンコーディング処理は小生自作の「azure-media-processor-java」を利用してバッチ実行している。\n2. Cognitive Services Face APIによる顔の検出と人物の識別 ここではCognitive ServicesのFace APIを使って１で得られたフレームごとの静止画像に対して顔検出を行い、予め登録している人物リスト（Face APIでいうところのPerson Group）と比較して最も類似度の高い人物（Face APIでいうところのPerson ）をその本人として識別する。\n2-1. 人物リスト（Person Group）の作成 人物リスト（Person Group）の作成で必要な作業とFace APIの利用インターフェースは次の通り:\n Create a Person Group APIを使って Person Groupを作成 上記で作成したPerson Groupの中にCreate a Person APIで人物ごとにPersonを作成する。作成されたPerson対してAdd a Person Face APIでその人物の顔画像を登録する。Face APIでは各Personに最大248枚の顔画像を登録が可能となっており、さまざまな種類の顔を登録することで機械学習によりその人物の顔識別の精度が向上するとされている。 上記でPerson Groupに対して登録されたPersonデータ（Personごとの顔データ）は最終的にTrain Person Group APIでトレーニングされることで、次の2-2で行う顔識別（Face Identify API）処理で利用可能なデータとなる。注意点として、いくらある人物の顔画像を登録したとしてもそれがトレーニングされない限り顔識別処理において有効にはならないため、新しく顔を登録した場合はトレーニング処理を忘れずに行ってください（この手のことは自動化しておいてください）。  2-2. 静止画像中の顔認識と人物識別 ここで行う処理の流れとFace APIの利用インターフェースは次の通り:\n Face Detect APIを使って静止画像中の顔を検出する。検出された顔ごとに固有のIDが得られる。尚、1枚の画像で複数の顔が検出された場合、最大64までは取得可能となっている（2016年12月現在）。 上記の顔検出で得られた顔IDを元にFace Identify APIを使って2-1で登録した人物リスト（Person Group）に対して人物検索を行い顔の類似度（0～1の数値）が高いもの順に一覧を取得することができる。ここでは最も類似度が高い人物をその顔の人物として決定する。  3. 字幕(Closed Caption)データファイルの生成 2で得られた各フレーム中の人物情報と各フレームの時間を元に字幕用のデータフォーマットであるWebVTTフォーマットファイルを生成する。以下、6秒～30秒までの字幕出力を期したWebVTTファイルのサンプルであるが、見ていただいてわかる通りフレームの時間（最小秒単位）とそこで得られた人物名をセットで記述するとても単純なフォーマットとなっている。\n00:00:06.000 --\u0026gt; 00:00:07.000 Satya Nadella(0.73295)` 00:00:07.000 --\u0026gt; 00:00:08.000 Satya Nadella(0.6313) 00:00:27.000 --\u0026gt; 00:00:28.000 Bryan Roper(0.68094) 00:00:29.000 --\u0026gt; 00:00:30.000 Bryan Roper(0.54939) 各フレームの時間について、今回のビデオコンテンツのフレームは1秒ごとに取得しており、フレームごとの静止画像ファイルにはフレームの順番がPostfixとしてファイル名に含まれているため単純にファイル名からフレームの時間が特定できるようになっている（例, 10番目のファイル= videoassetname_000010.jpg）。もし今回のような機械的なルールがない場合はフレーム用画像ファイル名と時間のマッピングが必要となる。\nビデオコンテンツと字幕の再生は「ビデオコンテンツの音声認識デモ」でも紹介したようにHTML5のtrackタグエレメントによるビデオファイルの字幕表示機能使って人物名の字幕表示を実現している。本デモではHTML5に下記のようにビデオファイル（MP4）をVideoソースとしてtrackエレメントにWebVTTファイル（build2016keynote.vtt）を指定している。\n\u0026lt;video id=\u0026#34;Video1\u0026#34; controls autoplay width=\u0026#34;600\u0026#34;\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;source src=\u0026#34;KEY01_VideoThumbnail.mp4\u0026#34; srclang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;video/mp4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;track id=\u0026#34;trackJA\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;build2016keynote.vtt\u0026#34; kind=\u0026#34;captions\u0026#34; srclang=\u0026#34;ja\u0026#34; label=\u0026#34;Person Name\u0026#34; default\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/video\u0026gt; デモデータ作成手順 GithubプロジェクトページVideoFramesFaceRecognition-Pythonの1. Preparationと2. Batch executionを実施いただければFace APIで識別した各フレームごとの人物名を元に字幕データ*.vttファイルが生成されデモページ表示のための準備は完了する。最後に表示用の静的ページを生成すれば完了。本デモの表示用ページデータはこちらで、基本的にindex.htmlの変更のみでいけるはず。\n本デモコンテンツについて何か問題を発見した場合はこちらのGithub IssueページにIssueとして登録いただけると幸いである。\nAzure Media Analytics Face Detectorを活用した処理の効率化 今回の人物識別ではビデオコンテンツの全てのフレームに対してFace APIを使って顔検出処理を行っているが、これでは顔出現フレームが少ないコンテンツの場合には無駄なFace APIリクエストが大量に発生してしまうため効率的な処理とは言えない。ということで、ここではAzure Media Face Detectorを活用して処理を効率化する方法を紹介したい。\nAzure Media Face DetectorはAzure Media Servicesのメディアプロセッサ(MP)の１つで、ビデオコンテンツから顔の検出や感情の検出をすることができる。残念ながらAzure Media Face DetectorはFace APIのように顔の識別を行うことはできないものの、ビデオコンテンツから直接顔を検出することができる、即ちビデオコンテンツから直接顔が存在するフレームを特定することができる。よって、この機能を利用して一旦Azure Media Face Detectorで顔が検出されたフレームのみに絞り込んでからFace APIを使ってフレームの静止画像に対して顔検出・顔識別を行うことで無駄なFace APIリクエストを減らして処理の効率化を図ることができる。処理フローとしては次のようなイメージ。\nおまけ: Video Summarization デモページをみていただくとお分かりのように今回のデモでは3分のビデオコンテンツを題材としているが、元ネタはChannel9で公開されている計138分のBuild 2016のキーノートセッションである。このキーノートのセッションはデモコンテンツとしてはあまりに長かったのでこれをAzure Media Video Thumbnailsメディアプロセッサ（MP）を使って3分に要約している。Azure Media Video Thumbnailsはアルゴリズムベースで特徴シーンの検出とそれらを結合（サブクリップ）してビデオコンテンツを指定した長さに要約することができるMPで、現在Public Previewリリース中(2016年12月現在)。\n参考までに、要約（3分:180秒）に使用したAzure Media Video Thumbnailsのタスクプリセットは以下の通り：\n{  \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: {  \u0026#34;outputAudio\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;maxMotionThumbnailDurationInSecs\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;180\u0026#34;,  \u0026#34;fadeInFadeOut\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;  } } END\n","permalink":"https://unofficialism.info/posts/azure-media-cognitive-demos-video-frames-face-recognition/","summary":"過去に本ブログでビデオコンテンツを切り口とした音声認識やOCR技術を利用したデモを紹介したが、ここではビデオコンテンツの中の人物出現箇所に連動して人物名を字幕で表示させるデモとその実装方法を紹介したい。人物識別にはAzureのCognitive ServicesのFace APIを使っていて、これで動画の中に出現する顔の検出を行い、予め登録している人物リストとのマッチングにより実現している。 Cognitive Serivcesとは視覚、音声、言語、知識などマイクロソフトがこれまで研究を通じて開発してきたさまざまな要素技術をAPIとして提供しているサービスのことで、最近巷で人工知能（AI）だとかインテリジェンスとかいうキーワードをよく耳にするのではないかと思うがAzure利用シナリオでそういったインテリジェンス（知能/知性）を兼ね備えたアプリを作る場合は間違いなく中核となるサービスの1つである。Face APIはその中でも顔の検出・識別や、顔にまつわる感情、特徴などメタデータ抽出に特化したAPIである。\n\n demo site source code  主要テクノロジーと機能 下図は今回のデモ作成のために行っている処理フローと主要テクノロジーを表している。やっていることは大きく分けて3つ: (1) 動画コンテンツをAzure Media Encoder Standardを使ってフレームごとの静止画像の作成, (2) Cognitive ServicesのFace APIを使って1より得られた静止画像から顔の検出を行い予め登録している人物リストとマッチング（最も類似度が高いものを本人とみなす）して人物を識別, (3) 2で得られた各フレーム中の人物情報を時間順に並べて字幕(Closed Caption)用のデータファイルを生成。以下、各処理の詳細について説明する。\n1.

Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data. fluent-plugin-azurefunctions is a fluentd output plugin that enables to collect events into Azure Functions.\nPre-requisites  A basic understanding of fluentd - if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with fluentd, fluentd quickstart guide is good starting point Azure subscription - you need to have Azure subscription that grants you access to Microsoft Azure services, and under which you can create Azure Functions account. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have yet click here to create it  Setup: Azure Functions (HTTP Trigger Function) Create a function (HTTP Trigger). First, you need to have an function app that hosts the execution of your functions in Azure if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have. Once you have an function app, you can create a function. Here are instructions:\n Create your first Azure Function Azure Functions developer reference  A quick-start HTTP trigger function sample is included under examples/function-csharp in Github repository. You simply need to save the code (run.csx) and configuration files (function.json, project.json) in the same Azure function folder. Explaining a little bit about each of files, the function.json file defines the function bindings and other configuration settings. The runtime uses this file to determine the events to monitor and how to pass data into and return data from function execution. The project.json defines packages that the application depends. The run.csx is a core application file where you write your code to process Your jobs. Here is a sample run.csx:\nusing System.Net; using Newtonsoft.Json;  public static async Task\u0026lt;HttpResponseMessage\u0026gt; Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log) {  log.Info(\u0026#34;C# HTTP trigger function to process fluentd output request.\u0026#34;);  log.Info( string.Format(\u0026#34;Dump request:\\n {0}\u0026#34;,req.ToString()));  // parse query parameter  string payload = req.GetQueryNameValuePairs()  .FirstOrDefault(q =\u0026gt; string.Compare(q.Key, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;, true) == 0)  .Value;  // Get request body  dynamic data = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync\u0026lt;object\u0026gt;();  if (data.payload == null) {  log.Info(\u0026#34;Please pass a payload on the query string or in the request body\u0026#34;);  return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);  }  // Process Your Jobs!  dynamic r = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject\u0026lt;dynamic\u0026gt;((string)data.payload);  if (r.key1!=null) log.Info(string.Format(\u0026#34;key1={0}\u0026#34;,r.key1));  if (r.key2!=null) log.Info(string.Format(\u0026#34;key2={0}\u0026#34;,r.key2));  if (r.key3!=null) log.Info(string.Format(\u0026#34;key3={0}\u0026#34;,r.key3));  if (r.mytime!=null) log.Info(string.Format(\u0026#34;mytime={0}\u0026#34;,r.mytime));  if (r.mytag!=null) log.Info(string.Format(\u0026#34;mytag={0}\u0026#34;,r.mytag));  return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK); } Setup: Fluentd First of all, install Fluentd. The following shows how to install Fluentd using Ruby gem packger but if you are not using Ruby Gem for the installation, please refer to this installation guide where you can find many other ways to install Fluentd on many platforms.\n# install fluentd $ sudo gem install fluentd --no-ri --no-rdoc  # create fluent.conf $ fluentd --setup Also, install fluent-plugin-azurefunctions for fluentd aggregator to send collected event data into Azure Functions.\n$ sudo gem install fluent-plugin-azurefunctions Next, configure fluent.conf, a fluentd configuration file as follows. Please refer to this for fluent-plugin-azurefunctions configuration. The following is a sample configuration where the plugin writes only records that are specified by key_names in incoming event stream out to Azure Functions:\n# This is used by event forwarding and the fluent-cat command \u0026lt;source\u0026gt;  @type forward  @id forward_input \u0026lt;/source\u0026gt;  # Send Data to Azure Functions \u0026lt;match azurefunctions.**\u0026gt;  @type azurefunctions  endpoint AZURE_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT # ex. https://\u0026lt;accountname\u0026gt;.azurewebsites.net/api/\u0026lt;functionname\u0026gt;  function_key AZURE_FUNCTION_KEY # ex. aRVQ7Lj0vzDhY0JBYF8gpxYyEBxLwhO51JSC7X5dZFbTvROs7uNg==  key_names key1,key2,key3  add_time_field true  time_field_name mytime  time_format %s  localtime true  add_tag_field true  tag_field_name mytag \u0026lt;/match\u0026gt; [note] If key_names not specified above, all incoming records are posted to Azure Functions (See also this).\nFinally, run fluentd with the fluent.conf that you configure above.\n$ fluentd -c ./fluent.conf -vv \u0026amp; TEST Let\u0026rsquo;s check if test events will be sent to Azure Functions that triggers the HTTP function (let\u0026rsquo;s use the sample function included in Github repo this time). First, generate test events using fluent-cat like this:\necho \u0026#39; { \u0026#34;key1\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;value1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;key2\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;value2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;key3\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;value3\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; | fluent-cat azurefunctions.msg As both add_time_field and add_tag_field are enabled, time and tag fields are added to the record that are selected by key_names before posting to Azure Functions, thus actual HTTP Post request body would be like this:\n{  \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;key1\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;value1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;key2\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;value2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;key3\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;value3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mytime\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1480195100\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mytag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;azurefunctions.msg\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; } If events are sent to the function successfully, a HTTP trigger function handles the events and the following logs can be seen in Azure Functions log stream:\n2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 Function started (Id=5392e7ae-3b8e-4f65-9fc1-6ae529cdfe3a) 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 C# HTTP trigger function to process fluentd output request. 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 key1=value1 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 key2=value2 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 key3=value3 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 mytime=1480195100 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 mytag=azurefunctions.msg 2016-11-26T21:18:55.200 Function completed (Success, Id=5392e7ae-3b8e-4f65-9fc1-6ae529cdfe3a) Advanced Senarios 1. Near Real-time processing Function Apps can output messages to different means or data stores. For example, fluentd collects events generated from IoT devices and send them to Azure Function, and the the HTTP trigger function transforms the events and processes the data to store in a persistent storage or to pass them to different means. Here are some of options available at the time of writing:\n Store JSON documents on DocumentDB Send events to Event Hub Send messages to Azure Service Bus Queues Send messages to Azure Storage Queues Store blobs to Azure Blob Storage Push notifications to Notification Hub [Send SMS text messages via Twilio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-twilio) Send emails via SendGrid  2. Background jobs processing If the jobs are expected to be large long running ones, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended that you refactor them into smaller function sets that work together and return fast responses. For example, you can pass the HTTP trigger payload into a queue to be processed by a queue trigger function. Or if the payload is too big to pass into the queue, you can store them onto Azure Blob storage at first, then pass only limited amount of the data into a queue just to trigger background workers to process the actual work. These approaches allow you to do the actual work asynchronously and return an immediate response.\nLINKS  fluent-plugin-azurefunctions Azure Functions Overview Azure functions Triggers and Bindings Azure Functions Best Practices  END\n","permalink":"https://unofficialism.info/posts/fluent-plugin-azurefunctions/","summary":"In this article, I’d like to introduces a solution to collect events from various sources and send them into HTTP Trigger function in Azure Functions using fluent-plugin-azurefunctions.

If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with fluent-plugin-documentdb, read my previous article before move on.\nPartitioned collections is kick-ass feature that I had wanted to support in fluent-plugin-documentdb since the feature came out public (see the announcement).

Check this out if you\u0026rsquo;re interested).\nWhat are Partitioned collections? According to official documentation, Partitioned collections can span multiple partitions and support very large amounts of storage and throughput. You must specify a partition key for the collection. Partitioned collections can support larger data volumes and process more requests compared to Single-partitioned collection. Partitioned collections support up to 250 GB of storage and 250,000 request units per second of provisioned throughput[Updated Aug 21, 2016] (@arkramac pointed that out for me) Partitioned collections support unlimited storage and throughput. 250GB storage and 250k req/sec are soft cap. You can increase these limits by contacting and asking Azure support.\nOn the other hand, Single-partition collections have lower price options and the ability to query and perform transactions across all collection data. They have the scalability and storage limits of a single partition. You do not have to specify a partition key for these collections.\nCreation of Partitioned collections You can create Partitioned collections via the Azure portal, REST API ( \u0026gt;= version 2015-12-16), and client SDKs in .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python. In addition, you let fluent-plugin-documentdb create Partitioned collections automatically by adding the following configuration options upon the ones for single-partitioned collection in fluentd.conf:\n auto_create_collection true partitioned_collection true partition_key [partition key for the collection] offer_throughput [Offer throughtput value: must be more than and equals to 10100. See this for more info on offer throughtput in creating collection]  It creates a partitioned collection as you configure in starting the plugin if not exist at that time.\nConfiguration Example Suppose that you want to read Apache access log as source for fluentd, and that you pick \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo; as a partition Key for the collection, you can configure the plugin like this following:\n\u0026lt;source\u0026gt;  @type tail # input plugin  path /var/log/apache2/access.log # monitoring file  pos_file /tmp/fluentd_pos_file # position file  format apache # format  tag documentdb.access # tag \u0026lt;/source\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;match documentdb.*\u0026gt;  @type documentdb  docdb_endpoint https://yoichikademo.documents.azure.com:443/  docdb_account_key Tl1xykQxnExUisJ+BXwbbaC8NtUqYVE9kUDXCNust5aYBduhui29Xtxz3DLP88PayjtgtnARc1PW+2wlA6jCJw==  docdb_database mydb  docdb_collection my-partitioned-collection  auto_create_database true  auto_create_collection true  partitioned_collection true  partition_key host  offer_throughput 10100  localtime true  time_format %Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S  add_time_field true  time_field_name time  add_tag_field true  tag_field_name tag \u0026lt;/match\u0026gt; Basically that\u0026rsquo;s all additional configuration for Partitioned collections.

Please see this for fluent-plugin-documentdb configuration.\n# Receive events from 24224/tcp # This is used by log forwarding and the fluent-cat command \u0026lt;source\u0026gt;  @type forward  port 24224 \u0026lt;/source\u0026gt;  # Store Data in DocumentDB \u0026lt;match apache.access\u0026gt;  @type documentdb  docdb_endpoint https://yoichikademo.documents.azure.com:443/  docdb_account_key Tl1+ikQtnExxxUisJ+BXwbbaC8NtUqYVE9kUDXCNust5aYBduhui29Xtxz3DLP88PayjtgtnARc1PW+2wlA6jCJw== (dummy)  docdb_database LogDB  docdb_collection Collection1  auto_create_database true  auto_create_collection true  time_format %Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S  localtime true  add_time_field true  time_field_name time  add_tag_field true  tag_field_name tag \u0026lt;/match\u0026gt; Regarding he port number of the aggregator host above, the default is 24224. Note that both TCP packets (event stream) and UDP packets (heartbeat message) are sent to this port, which mean you need to open both TCP and UDP for this port if you have access controls between forwarders and aggregator. Please see the forward Output plugin article to understand more about forward plugin.\nFinally, run fluentd with specifiying fluent.conf that you configurea above.\n$ fluentd -c ./fluent.conf -vv \u0026amp; Setup: Fluentd Forwarders First, to set up Fluentd, run the following command to setup Fluentd. Again If you are not using Ruby Gem for the installation, please refer to the installation document.\n# install fluentd $ sudo gem install fluentd --no-ri --no-rdoc`  # create fluent.conf $ fluentd --setup Then, give Fluentd a read access to servers\u0026rsquo;log files.\n$ sudo chmod og+rx /var/log/apache2 $ sudo chmod og+r /var/log/apache2/* Next, configure fluent.conf, a fluentd configuration file as follows to tail apache access logs and forard event to aggregator\n# Apache Access Logs \u0026lt;source\u0026gt;  @type tail  path /var/log/apache2/access.log # monitoring file  pos_file /tmp/fluentd_pos_file # position file  format apache # format  tag apache.access # tag \u0026lt;/source\u0026gt;  # Forward data to the aggregator \u0026lt;match apache.access\u0026gt;  @type forward  buffer_type memory  buffer_chunk_limit 8m  buffer_queue_limit 64  flush_interval 1s  \u0026lt;server\u0026gt;  host \u0026lt;Aggregator\u0026#39;s hostname or IP\u0026gt;  port 24224  \u0026lt;/server\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;secondary\u0026gt;  @type file  path /var/log/fluentd/forward-failed  \u0026lt;/secondary\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/match\u0026gt; Finally, start Fluentd with the configuration above to start log collections\n$ fluentd -c ./fluent.conf -vv \u0026amp; TEST Let\u0026rsquo;s check if logs will be forwarded from apache nodes to aggegator and ultimately stored in documentdb. First, create log events by sending test requests to web servers somehow (here using apache bench for example)\n$ ab -n 5 -c 2 http://\u0026lt;targetserver\u0026gt;/foo/bar/test.html If logs are collected successfully, you can see the logs stored in DocumentDB easily by using Document DB\u0026rsquo;s query explorer. Go to Azure Portal \u0026gt; Display your DocumentDB dashboard \u0026gt; Query Explorer.\nMore log collections from external sources Fluentd\u0026rsquo;s Input plugins extend Fluentd to retrieve and pull event logs from external sources. An input plugin typically creates a thread socket and a listen socket. It can also periodically pull data from data sources. For examples, listening syslog events, tailing apache/nginx logs, and pulling data from well-known RDBMS/NoSQLs on-premices or on public cloud.

[ServerX] netcat のプロキシ指定は-xオプションで行う。 ここでは事前に作成したSOCKSプロキシ(localhost:1080)を指定。 netcatトンネルの作成コマンドはProxyCommandに記述する。こちらも毎回長いオプション入力を避けるために config（ssh_config）設定すると便利である。\n** ~/.ssh/config**\nHost ServerX  User [Account]  Protocol 2  ForwardAgent yes  ProxyCommand nc -x localhost:1080 -w1 %h %p 注意点として、netcatにはGNU本家版とそれ以外にいくつか派生があるが-x オプションの利用可能なnetcatである必要がある。オリジナルのnetcatやGNU netcatには-xオプションはない。ここで使用しているnetcatはIPv6に対応しているOpenBSD netcat。\nもちろんVNET内のVMへのSSH接続の別解としてProxyCommandでJump ServerからServerXへnetcatトンネルを作成してlocalからServerXにログインすることも可能。\nlocal$ ssh -2 -o \u0026#39;ProxyCommand ssh [Jump Server] nc -w1 %h %p\u0026#39; [ServerX] 実はこの方法のほうがProxyCommand でプロキシ設定を行うため事前に別コンソールで何かを用意する必要がなく間違いなくSOCKSプロキシ経由での接続よりも楽。ではSOCKSプロキシ経由で接続する理由は何か？ 理由は単純で、通常Jump Serverはセキュリティ設定上の理由でログインしてもほとんど何もできないようにするために機能を無効化していることが多く、よってnetcatが使えない(ncはおろかsshコマンド以外ほとんど何も使えない)環境だったりする。この場合、上記で説明したようにSOCKSプロキシ経由でのSSHログインが有効な手段となる。\nSOCKSプロキシ経由でのブラウジング ブラウザーにSOCKSプロキシ対応のプラグインを\t入れることでブラウザーによるプライベートリソース（内部ネットワーク内のアプリ・ミドルウェア等のウェブUIを持った管理ツールなど）の閲覧も可能となる。有名なものにSwitchySharp(Google Chrome)やFoxyproxy(Firefox)などがある。以下簡単な設定スクリーンショットを乗せておく。共に「http://yoichika-.cloudapp.net」なURIパターンの時にのみSOCKSプロキシlocalhost:12345経由でアクセスする設定となっている。\nGoogle Chrome - SwitchySharp\nFirefox - Foxyproxy\nInternet Explorer - Out-of-box feature\nAs answered in Stack Overflow, Internet Explorer does support SOCKS proxies.\nTools \u0026gt;

[ServerX] netcat のプロキシ指定は-xオプションで行う。 ここでは事前に作成したSOCKSプロキシ(localhost:1080)を指定。 netcatトンネルの作成コマンドはProxyCommandに記述する。こちらも毎回長いオプション入力を避けるために config（ssh_config）設定すると便利である。","title":"SOCKSプロキシを経由したAzure VNETプライベートリソースへのアクセス"},{"content":"ARMとAzure Insights API Azure上のさまざまなサービスのメトリック情報をAPI経由で取得したい。そういうことであればAzure Service Management APIを使えばいいじゃないかという声が聞こえてきそうなところだが実は既にこのやり方は時代遅れとなっていることをご存じだろうか？ 2014年5月ごろ？に登場したAzureの新しい考え方にResource、ResourceGroup、Azure Resource Managerというものがある。簡単な説明すると、Azure上のPaaSインスタンス、仮想マシンなどすべての管理可能な資源をリソース(Resource)とよばれる単位に細分化し、それらをグループ化したものがResourceGroup、そして全てのリソースはAzure Resource Manager（以下ARM）というもので管理可能になっている。そしてこのARMで管理可能な世界のリソース群に紐づくメトリックデータはAzure Insights APIで取得可能となっている。本記事ではさまざまなリソースの中でもWeb Appsに絞って、Azure Insights REST API (Metric)を使ってそのメトリックを取得する方法について紹介する。\nARM Explorerでどのメトリックが取得可能なのか確認する ARM Explorer (https://resources.azure.com/) をご存じだろうか？　これはその名の通りAzure上の全てのリソース（ご利用のサブスクリプションに紐づく全てのリソース）のエクスプローラーであり、これを使うことでこのARM管理下の世界のすべてのリソースをエクスプローラービューで閲覧することができる。このARM Explorerで閲覧可能な各リソースの情報の中にmetricdefinitionsというものがあって、これにはそのリソースに対して指定可能なメトリックの種類やその定義情報などが格納されている。リソースのメトリック取得をする際は、まずはARM Explorerで目的のリソースのmetricdefinitionsから指定可能なメトリックの種類を把握してからAPIリクエストを組み立てていただければと思う。ARM Explorerを使って本記事で取得対象としているWeb Apps（ここではサイト名yoichikademoを対象）のmetricdefinitionsを閲覧しているのが以下のスクリーンショットになる。\nAzure Insights REST APIメトリック取得インターフェース Azure Insights APIには次のような(1)メトリック定義一覧の取得と(2)対象リソースのメトリック情報取得の2つのインターフェースがある。当然ながらメトリックの取得には(2)のインターフェースを使用する。\n(1)メトリック定義一覧取得\nGET https://management.azure.com /subscriptions/{-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider-namespace}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}/metricDefinitions [Parameters] api-version={api-version} $filter={filter} (2)メトリック情報取得\nGET https://management.azure.com /subscriptions/{-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider-namespace}/sites/{sitename}/metrics [Parameters] api-version={api-version} $filter={filter} APIの共通部分は下記の通り。Azure Insights APIへの全ての要求はAzure Active Directoryを使用して認証する必要があり、この認証により得られたトークンを各APIリクエストのAuthorizationヘッダに指定する必要がある。トークン取得の方法にはPowerShellを使用した方法とAzure管理ポータルを使用して認証する2つの方法がある。詳しくは「Azure インサイト要求を認証する」を参照ください。\n {api-version}：\u0026ldquo;2014-04-01\u0026rdquo;

AS \u0026ldquo;Searchフィールド名\u0026quot;でインジェスト先フィールド名を指定する。データソース定義については後述の設定内容を確認ください。\nConfiguration 以下１～４のステップでデータソースの作成、検索インデックスの作成、インデクサーの作成、インデクサーの実行を行う。\n(1) データソースの作成\ncredential.connectionStringで接続先DocumentDB文字列と対象データベースの指定を行う。container.(name|query)で対象コレクション名と参照用SELECT文を指定する。SELECT文はDocumentDBとインジェスト先Azure Searchのフィールドセット（フィールド名と数）が同じであれば省略可。詳細はこちらを参照。\n#!/bin/sh SERVICE_NAME=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;Azure Search Service Name\u0026gt;\u0026#39;
