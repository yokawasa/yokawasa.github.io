title: fluent-plugin-documentdb supports Partitioned collections
---

I&rsquo;d like to announce [fluent-plugin-documentdb](https://github.com/yokawasa/fluent-plugin-documentdb) finally supports Azure DocumentDB Partitioned collections for higher storage and throughput. If you're not familiar with fluent-plugin-documentdb, read [my previous article](http://unofficialism.info/posts/collecting-logs-into-azure-documentdb-using-fluent-plugin-documentdb/) before move on.

Partitioned collections is kick-ass feature that I had wanted to support in fluent-plugin-documentdb since the feature came out public (see [the announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/ja-jp/updates/documentdb-partitioned-collections-for-higher-storage-and-throughput/)). For big fan of fluent-plugin-documentdb, sorry for keeping you waiting for such a long time :-) If I may make excuses, I would say I haven't had as much time on the project, and I had to do ruby client implementation of Partitioned collections by myself as there is no official DocumentDB Ruby SDK that supports it (As a result I've created tiny Ruby DocumentDB client libraries that support the feature. Check [this](https://github.com/yokawasa/fluent-plugin-documentdb/tree/master/lib/fluent/plugin/documentdb) out if you're interested).

## What are Partitioned collections?

According to [ official documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-partition-data/), **Partitioned collections** can span multiple partitions and support very large amounts of storage and throughput. You must specify a **partition key** for the collection. Partitioned collections can support larger data volumes and process more requests compared to Single-partitioned collection. ~~Partitioned collections support **up to 250 GB** of storage and **250,000 request units per second** of provisioned throughput~~[Updated Aug 21, 2016] ([@arkramac](https://twitter.com/arkramac) pointed [that](https://twitter.com/yokawasa/status/766908784467783680) out for me) Partitioned collections support unlimited storage and throughput. 250GB storage and 250k req/sec are soft cap. You can increase these limits by contacting and asking [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-increase-limits/). 

On the other hand, Single-partition collections have lower price options and the ability to query and perform transactions across all collection data. They have the scalability and storage limits of a single partition. You do not have to specify a partition key for these collections.

## Creation of Partitioned collections

You can create Partitioned collections via the Azure portal, REST API ( >= version 2015-12-16), and client SDKs in .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python. In addition, you let fluent-plugin-documentdb create Partitioned collections automatically by adding the following configuration options upon the ones for single-partitioned collection in fluentd.conf: 

- **auto_create_collection** true
- **partitioned_collection** true
- **partition_key** [partition key for the collection]
- **offer_throughput** [Offer throughtput value: must be more than and equals to `10100`. See [this](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-create-collection/) for more info on offer throughtput in creating collection]

It creates a partitioned collection as you configure in starting the plugin if not exist at that time.

## Configuration Example

Suppose that you want to read Apache access log as source for fluentd, and that you pick "host" as a partition Key for the collection, you can configure the plugin like this following:

```xml
<source>
    @type tail                          # input plugin
    path /var/log/apache2/access.log   # monitoring file
    pos_file /tmp/fluentd_pos_file     # position file
    format apache                      # format
    tag documentdb.access              # tag
</source>

<match documentdb.*>
    @type documentdb
    docdb_endpoint https://yoichikademo.documents.azure.com:443/
    docdb_account_key Tl1xykQxnExUisJ+BXwbbaC8NtUqYVE9kUDXCNust5aYBduhui29Xtxz3DLP88PayjtgtnARc1PW+2wlA6jCJw==
    docdb_database mydb
    docdb_collection my-partitioned-collection
    auto_create_database true
    auto_create_collection true
    partitioned_collection true 
    partition_key host
    offer_throughput 10100
    localtime true
    time_format %Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S
    add_time_field true
    time_field_name time
    add_tag_field true
    tag_field_name tag
</match>
```

Basically that's all additional configuration for Partitioned collections. Please refer to [my previous article](http://unofficialism.info/posts/collecting-logs-into-azure-documentdb-using-fluent-plugin-documentdb/) for the rest of setup and running work for the plugin. 

Happy log collections with fluent-plugin-documentdb!!
