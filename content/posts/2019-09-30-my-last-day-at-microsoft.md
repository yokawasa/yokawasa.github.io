title: My last day at Microsoft
---

Today is my last day at Microsoft. 
About 9 years and 2 months have passed since I joined MS. I've had wonderful years filled with various experiences on business.

In the first 4 years, as FAST Search engineer & consultant, I specialized in Fast search and provided customers in Japan and sometimes in South East Asia & South Korea area with proactive consulting & support. For the next 3 years after that, as a part of Azure Solution Architect teams, I provided architectural guidance & design session, PoC and prototyping support, knowledge transfer trainings with Japanease enterprise customers, collaborating with Azure engineering teams, Azure sales teams and many other stakeholders. I also engaged with communities inside/outside Microsoft, participating in Microsoft hosting conferences / industry showcase events, and contributing OSS communities. In the latest 2 years, as a part of global technical SWAT team in enterprise sales organization internally called ‘Global Black Belt, I was responsible for leading technical engagements to win based on solutions leveraging the Microsoft Azure and OSS with a specialization in cloud native application architecture and development such as Microservices, Containers/Serverless, PaaS, DevOps, and so on. Along with my everyday job I had awesome opportunities to speak at conferences and meetups about many technical topics mostly on Cloud Native tech and architectures.  It was awesome 9 years and 2 months!!

I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to all the my customers and partners I have worked with so far. I also thank, each one of my colleague and managers who made my journey a memorable one in Microsoft. 

I will start a new phase of my career from tomorrow. But it is indeed a small world in our industry. I hope our paths cross again, and it would be great if we may be able to work together again somewhere.
