      <description>Today is my last day at Microsoft. About 9 years and 2 months have passed since I joined MS. I&amp;rsquo;ve had wonderful years filled with various experiences on business.
In the first 4 years, as FAST Search engineer &amp;amp; consultant, I specialized in Fast search and provided customers in Japan and sometimes in South East Asia &amp;amp; South Korea area with proactive consulting &amp;amp; support. For the next 3 years after that, as a part of Azure Solution Architect teams, I provided architectural guidance &amp;amp; design session, PoC and prototyping support, knowledge transfer trainings with Japanease enterprise customers, collaborating with Azure engineering teams, Azure sales teams and many other stakeholders.</description>
