      <description>Iâ€™d like to announce fluent-plugin-documentdb finally supports Azure DocumentDB Partitioned collections for higher storage and throughput. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with fluent-plugin-documentdb, read my previous article before move on.
Partitioned collections is kick-ass feature that I had wanted to support in fluent-plugin-documentdb since the feature came out public (see the announcement). For big fan of fluent-plugin-documentdb, sorry for keeping you waiting for such a long time :-) If I may make excuses, I would say I haven&amp;rsquo;t had as much time on the project, and I had to do ruby client implementation of Partitioned collections by myself as there is no official DocumentDB Ruby SDK that supports it (As a result I&amp;rsquo;ve created tiny Ruby DocumentDB client libraries that support the feature.</description>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduces a solution to collect logs and store them into Azure DocumentDB using fluentd and its plugin, fluent-plugin-documentdb.
Azure DocumentDB is a managed NoSQL database service provided by Microsoft Azure. It&amp;rsquo;s schemaless, natively support JSON, very easy-to-use, very fast, highly reliable, and enables rapid deployment, you name it. Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data.</description>
