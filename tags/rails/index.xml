      <description>Preface In this article, Iâ€™d like to introduces Finched Rails CLI that makes it a breeze to try out Rails without installing anything but finch. Finch is an OSS CLI for building, running, and publishing Linux containers create by AWS. As long as you have Finch, you can quick start a Rails app only by copying and pasting a few commands. Finched Rails CLI is a fork of Docked Rails CLI and simply a Finch version of it.</description>
